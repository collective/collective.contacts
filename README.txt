This product provides an address book where you can add Persons, Organizations and Groups

The address book has 3 customized views, one for Persons, one for Organizations and one for Groups.

The product is fully internationalized, so if you want it in your language, you just need to add another folder to the locales folder and add your language there.

It also features search capabilities, export, import and ability to send mail to several people.

Searching:
There's a quick search and an advanced search.
From the quick one, you can put any text and it will show you all users, organizations, or groups that have that text (or part of it) in any of their fields.
From the advanced one, you can specify text (or part of it) for each field from persons or organizations to do a more precise search.

Export:
At the moment you can export your persons or organizations to a csv file. It exports all fields from them, you can't filter.

Import:
You can import Persons or organizations, but csv has to have very precise format, so importing a csv that was exported using this exporter is reccomended.

Sending mail:
This product does not provide any form to send mails from the portal, what it does is provide you a mailto: with all persons, or organizations that you have selected, so you can send the email with your favorite email client without needing to copy&paste all of them.
